when creating a reposotory, using git init, a .get hidden folder gets created, we need a repository to record history of changes made to a number of files in a project


staging area s a place where changes are initially made and can used for reviewing

use commit after each logical add to the staging area

branch would be helpful when testing new things and for collaborative efforts

diagrams helps viewing which branch to check for each commit

git log --graph shows a graph of how things moved on. 

Merging branches together resulted in having all changes get saved in the master branch
